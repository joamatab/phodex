# PHODEX

Examples for photonic design problems using various open-source tools.

## Installation

You can install this by cloning the repository and doing a `pip install .`.
Note that this does not install _any_ dependencies.
The reason for this is that the requirements depend entirely on the examples that you want to run, so the recommended approach right now is to create an isolated environment (using e.g. [conda](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/index.html) or [pyenv](https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv)) and then install whatever packages are needed yourself for the examples you want to try.
Maybe there will be a more convenient way to do this in the future.

## Disclaimer

This project is intended as a resource for myself and for people wanting to get into (inverse) design in photonics.
I can make no guarantees on correctness or best practices for any of the examples contained herein (I do my best, though).
When in doubt, _always_ refer to the official documentation and examples of the tools that are used.
